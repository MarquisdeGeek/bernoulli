# Bernoulli
Calculating Bernoulli Numbers in Javascript with the Akiyama Tanigawa method

...in 212 characters!

```
   function      calculateB(k)         {function 
 h(b,      a){   return      a?h(     a,b%    a):b
 }for     (var   c=            [],    a=[]    ,e=0
 ,b,d     ,f,g   ;e             <=    k;)     for(
 c[d=e]=1,b=d,   a[             e]    =++e;d;)f=c[
 --d       ]*a   [b             ]-    (c[       b]
 *=g       =a[   d])           ,r=    h(f       *=
 b,g        =a   [b]         *=g)     ,c[       d]=
 f/r       ,a[   --b]=g/r;return      [c[       0]      ,a[0]]};

```

This was a purely fun exercise, to see how small the very first computer program could be nowadays!

```
function calculateB(k){function h(b,a){return a?h(a,b%a):b}for(var c=[],a=[],e=0,b,d,f,g;e<=k;)for(c[b=d=e]=1,a[e]=++e;d;)f=c[--d]*a[b]-(c[b]*=g=a[d]),r=h(f*=b,g=a[b]*=g),c[d]=f/r,a[--b]=g/r;return [c[0],a[0]]};
```

The `basic.js` file contains a readable version if you wish to understand how the method works.

`final.js` contains the human written code, and many iterations.

And finally, `short.js` shows what it looks like are renaming variables, removing spaces, and so forth. Generated by the Google Closure compiler, but could be done by hand.
